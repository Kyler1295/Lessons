    This Week's Lesson will focus on LoDash.  A Javascript Function Library that makes things 100% easier for developers by taking some of the most common functions
    and creating an easy library of functions to be called.

    To start we need to install Lodash using npm.

    (Following steps are if you're installing it yourself)

    *Note if on macOS add sudo before each command so sudo npm install instead of npm install

    Start with npm init and fill out the form

        npm init

    Open your terminal in the folder you want to install lodash and type: 
    
        npm i -g npm

    Next type

        npm i --save lodash

    Now you have lodash installed and we can call it just like a regular js file.  I have installed it in the large file in the web dev lessons so you only have to type
    npm install in the Lessons file.

    For a tutorial watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0

    ( If you run into an issue try adding a node_modules folder to the main folder )

    Next let's add Lodash to our document.

    -->

    <script src="../node_modules/lodash/lodash.js"></script>

    <!-- We now have lodash installed.  Lets take a look at just a few of it's functions. -->

    <!-- Let's say you want to filter an array to be only of unique items. Let's say you and your significant other both are adding items to a shopping list. -->

    <script>
    // Shopping List
    const shoppingList = ['Bread', 'Apples', 'Bananas', 'Soda', 'Grapes', 'Bread'];

    // But by accident your significant other added Bread when you already added it.  To fix this in regular javascript would be a real pain but thanks to lodash it looks like this.
    const newShoppingList = _.uniq(shoppingList);

    // Let's console.log it
    console.log(newShoppingList);

    // Let's look at a few more.  Lets say we want to make sure something is not a number.  

    // All we have to do is

    var number = 5;

    var isItANumber = _.isNaN(number) ? 'Not a number' : 'It\'s a number';

    console.log(isItANumber);

    // Check it out in the console.
    </script>

    <!-- If you want to read more about lodash check out the docs here: https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10#isNaN -->

    <!-- For this weeks project I want you to get two random numbers between 0 and 5000 and multiple them together using only lodash. -->
