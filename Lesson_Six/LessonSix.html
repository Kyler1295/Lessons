    <!-- This lesson will focus on refining Javascript skills and teaching a few new ones. -->

    <!-- 

        Every CSS property has a javascript equivalent that allows us to change the styles of an element.

        Lets say we want to change the background-color of a div with an id of box.

        <div id="box"></div>

        First we have to grab the element -> const box = document.querySelector('#box');
        Next we focus in on the style property of the element. -> box.style ( you can look at all of these elements by just console.log(box) and looking at the console.)
        Finally we want change the background-color so -> box.style.backgroundColor = '#c8102e';

        Notice the camel case instead of the - from normal css.  When in doubt remove the - and camel case the property.

        Although this may not be something insanely new the idea of changing properties with JS over jQuery 
        has grown drastically over the last few years so knowing how to do it is important.

        I know this seemed like a short lesson but this project will utilize multiple skills and keep you refreshed
        on your Javascript as we dive deeper into Vue.

        Project: 

            Create a website with the following requirements.

                1. A width of 100vw and a Height of 100vh, It does not have to be responsive.
                2. Include a header, nav, main, aside, and footer.
                3. Create a button in the bottom right corner that is fixed.
                4. When the button is pressed the grid reshapes itself ( footer where the header was, aside switches, etc.  Whatever you want.)
                5. Once clicked the grid changes from light colors to dark colors, a night mode.
