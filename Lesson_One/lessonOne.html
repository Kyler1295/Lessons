<!-- 

    This first lesson will teach you the basic understanding of how modern ES6 Javascript works.  
    Knowing modern standard vanilla JS is the key to being successful with frameworks and almost any other web development step.

    This Lesson Will Cover:
        querySelector
        ES6 arrow functions
        var let and const
        ternary operators
        template literals.


    What is a query Selector?

-->

    <script>
    
        var element = document.querySelector('.element');

    </script>

<!-- A query selector allows us to grab an element by either it's ID or ClassName.  The example above would grab an element with a classname of element.
    This can also be used a .querySelectorAll('.className'); to grab ALL classes of a certain element.  You can also grab elements such as the footer
    by typing .querySelector('footer');

    This has become the defacto substitue for document.getElementbyID(); for most situations as it is more versatile and allows for a premade function to be
    created that allows for quick grabbing of elements

    e.g. : 

        function _(elementName) {
            return document.querySelector(elementName);
        };

        var element = _('.element');

-->

    <!-- What Is an arrow function? -->

    <script>
    
        element.addEventListener('click', (args) => {
            console.log('clicked!');
        });
        
    </script>


<!-- 

    Arrow functions are what has made ES6 so loved and quickly accepted into modern web development.  This becomes more apparent once we
    jump into javascript frameworks due to this being huge in specific functions for objects and arrays, for now though we can look at it
    at the most basic level which is the Event Listener.

    Previously an EventListener was written like this:

        element.addEventListener('click', function() {
            some code.
        });

        now we can just remove the function() and replace it with () =>

    For now don't worry too much past this as once we jump into Vue.js and Especially React will this become a large time saver.

 -->

 <!-- Var Let and Const -->

    <script>
    
        var element = 0;
        let element = 1;
        const element = 2;

    </script>

<!-- 

    var, let, and const have changed how we use Javascript to the point where most people ignore var in a standard project.

    Var = a global element that can be changed.
    Let = a scoped element that only changes within the scope of the project.
    Const = an element that CANNOT be changed.

    e.g. :

        Var number = 5;

            function changeNumber() {
                number = 7;
            }
        
        console.log(number) <- you would get 7.

        let number = 5;

            function changeNumber(){
                let number = 7;
            }
        
        console.log(number) <- you would get 5.

 -->

<!-- What is a ternary Operator? -->

    <script>
    
    isTrue ? Do This : Do That
    
    </script>


<!-- 
    
    Ternary Operators are basically fancy if else statements except faster, easier, and more efficient.

        Basically if the first condition is true 5 > 6 then do the first option console.log('true'); else do the second console.log('false');

        5 > 6 ? console.log('true') : console.log('false')

        easy right?

-->


<!-- What is a template literal? -->


    <script>
    
        var variable = 'some sort of text';

        var lecture = `<h1>something</h1> <p>something something ${variable} something something something</p>`;

    </script>

    <!-- 

        template literals allow for you to add long texts of strings and event html elements or javascript variables.
        any variable used within a template literal must be encased with ${} and the whole string must be encased with ` found below the escape key.

     -->

    Project:

        The project for the course is to create a button and an input that displays whatever is typed into the input.

            Objectives:
                1. Must show whatever is inside of the input as part of a div that cannot have an ID tag.
                2. If nothing is entered into the input, the div must show a message saying, you entered nothing.
                3. No functions are allowed except a single arrow function.

    A completed version of the project can be found in lessonOneFinal.html
