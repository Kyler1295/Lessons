<!-- 

    This first lesson will teach you the basic understanding of how modern ES6 Javascript works.  
    Knowing modern standard vanilla JS is the key to being successful with frameworks and almost any other web development step.

    This Lesson Will Cover:
        querySelector
        ES6 arrow functions
        var let and const
        ternary operators
        template literals.

    Project:

        The project for the course is to create a button and an input that displays whatever is typed into the input.

            Objectives:
                1. Must show whatever is inside of the input as part of a div that cannot have an ID tag and it must show as an h1.
                2. If nothing is entered into the input, the div must show a message saying, you entered nothing as an h3.
                3. No functions are allowed except a single arrow function.

    A completed version of the project can be found in lessonOneFinal.html
