    <!-- This week will be a larger project week.  We're going to utilize everything we learned to create a small web app -->

    <!-- The Application -->

    <!-- 

        Create a small web application utilizing Vue.js, the fetch api, vanilla javascript, and either flexbox, materialize, or bootstrap ( the demo will use bootstrap and bootswatch ).
        Requirements:
            1. Use the include pokemon.json file ( pulled from the pokemon api found in lesson three ) to perform a fetch request.
            2. Make the pokedex sortable by the pokemon name.
            3. Application must be mobile responsive.

            Note * The reason i've included the .json file is this api has a habit of being unbelievably slow and down frequently.  The process will be the same for the most part however the api call I used to get this information was http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/1/

            PokeAPI url: https://pokeapi.co/
            Bootswatch: https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/
